<ol>
    <li style="color: brown;"> CSS stands for Cascading Style sheets.</li>

<li style="color: brown;">CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li>

 <li  style="color: brown;"> <span class="text1">Css is not neccesary</span> <span class="text2">CSS saves a lot of work.</span>  it can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once  </li>
 <li style="color: brown;"><span class="text3">stylesheets are stored in CSS files</span> </li>
 </ol>
 <h2 style="color: red;">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
 <ul>
     <li style="color: brown;">Inline - by Using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
     <li style="color: brown;">Internal - by using a link element to link to an  external CSS files.
         <li style="color: brown;">External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
         <li style="color: brown;">The most common way to add CSS,  is to keep the tyles in extrnal CSS files. however,<span class="text4"> in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
     </li>
 </ul>
 <p style="color: brown;">When comparing CSS class vs ID, the diffrence is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID on th other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use aa special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by javaScript.</p>
 <p style="color: brown;"> In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style  or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
 <p style="color: brown;">There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied. </p>
